all sections become columns //
title + buttons remove the flex 0 0 100% //
half-sections get 100% width //
wide cards from second section get 80% width //
info container on all cards goes column, image gets 80% width + align-items: center (maybe justify-content: center)
all cards height goes 450px instead of 350px to fit all content
width on narrow cards gets boosted a bit to utilize space
sidebar maybe goes on top of main content with a column layout
